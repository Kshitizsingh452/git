- `git clone <repository_url>`: Clone a remote repository to your local machine.
- `git add <file>`: Add a file to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "commit message"`: Commit staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git status`: Display the status of your working directory and staged changes.
- `git log`: View the commit history.
- `git diff`: Show differences between the working directory and the last commit.

## Branching

- `git branch`: List all branches in the repository.
- `git branch <branch_name>`: Create a new branch.
- `git checkout <branch_name>`: Switch to an existing branch.
- `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`: Create and switch to a new branch.
- `git merge <branch_name>`: Merge changes from the specified branch into the current branch.
- `git rebase <branch_name>`: Reapply commits from one branch on top of another.

## Merging

- `git merge <branch_name>`: Incorporate changes from another branch into the current branch.
- `git merge --no-ff <branch_name>`: Perform a non-fast-forward merge, preserving branch history.
- `git mergetool`: Launch a tool to help resolve merge conflicts.

## Collaboration

- `git remote`: List remote repositories.
- `git remote add <name> <repository_url>`: Add a remote repository.
- `git fetch <remote_name>`: Fetch changes from a remote repository.
- `git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>`: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.
- `git push <remote_name> <branch_name>`: Push local commits to a remote repository.

## Advanced Topics

- `git submodule`: Manage Git submodules within your repository.

## Troubleshooting
